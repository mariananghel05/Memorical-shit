■ Arithmetic—The study of whole numbers and fractions.
Sample theorem: If you subtract an odd number from an even
number you get an odd number.
■ Geometry—The study of figures in space—points, lines,
curves, and three-dimensional objects. Sample theorem: The
angles of a triangle on a flat surface add up to 180 degrees.
■ Algebra—The use of abstract symbols to represent mathematical objects (numbers, lines, matrices, transformations), and
the study of the rules for combining those symbols. Sample
theorem: For any two numbers x and y, (x + y) × (x − y) = x^2 −y^2
■ Analysis—The study of limits. Sample theorem: The harmonic
series is divergent (that is, it increases without limit).
